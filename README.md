This is a browser based testing system designed to assess a participant's ability to process conflicting stimuli. It uses a jsPsych frontend to create the test, and a Flask backend to collect data for processing. Due to the personal nature of some of the parts of the project, this is currently only the main driver files that I worked on. The rest of the code may be uploaded at a later date, depending on what the researcher wishes.
